    <h2> About me </h2>
    <p> I am Deboleena Mukhopadhyay. I was born in an academic family. From the early school days I was very fond of mathematics. I had the ability to visualize complex problems in simpler steps. Following my passion I joined college to pursue a bachelor's degree in mathematics. In the second year of my bachelors, I was introduced with Boolean logic and C language. These two subjects attracted me towards computer science. I started to enjoy solving problems of different fields of mathematics like Numerical Analysis, Linear Programming Problem, Game theory by writing code in C. After completion of bachelor’s, I enrolled in the master’s program in Computer Application. I was very much interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. During the master's program I worked as an intern at the  Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition Unit of the Indian Statistical Institute. I developed a supervised learning algorithm that identified 11 different Indic scripts on torn documents. After graduation I worked as a research fellow on two interesting research projects. The first one was in Mining Engineering Department, where I developed a neural network model that could predict concentration of particles in air around surface mines that causing respiratory trouble. This model is now used by the Coal India Limited, a leading coal mining company in India. My other project was in bioinformatics. Here I worked on a gene selection algorithm from microarray data. My algorithm identified genes responsible for a particular types of cancer. When my research projects were near completion, I moved to California. I was already experienced in coding with different computer languages. After moving to Silicon Valley, I realized that we are living in an era of innovation where I can apply my software development skills as well as my research background to make lives of many people a lot better. I joined the master's program in software engineering at ITU to strengthen and widen my skillset. Now after being graduated I’m looking for a full-stack developer position where I can apply my technical skills and research background to drive growth and innovation in all of my projects.
